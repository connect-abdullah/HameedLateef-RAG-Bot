{"url": "https://www.hameedlatifhospital.com/board-of-directors/", "title": "Board of Directors - Hameed Latif Hospital", "page_type": "general_page", "main_content": "Board of Directors Home Board of Directors Chairman's Message Hameed Latif Hospital was founded in 1992 as a small 20 bedded hospital to provide maternity services mainly to the middle class. Since then, thanks to the endeavors of the management and support of consultants, it has grown into a major 350+ bed facility catering for all specialties – a creditable tenfold growth achieved in a span of 25 years. Healthcare is considered to be the responsibility of the state, where the Government is expected to provide free healthcare to the populace, irrespective of social status. Unfortunately, because of the paucity of funds, this has not been possible. At present government has allocated and is spending sizable sums of money on developing healthcare infrastructure, but the demand far outstrips the provision. This has opened the way for the private sector to step in and set up hospital facilities at all levels – tertiary, secondary and primary. These private sector initiatives to provide the needy with necessary medical services and facilities are to be lauded. Hameed Latif Hospital enjoys a unique status, it is located in the city center for easy accessibility and provides services in all major specialties, namely Maternity, Gynae, Paeds, General Surgery and Internal Medicine. It also provides excellent care to emergency patients with its fully equipped ICU and CCU facilities. Other valuable services include Cardiology, Cardiac Surgery, Neurology, Neuro Surgery, Medical Oncology, Orthopedic, plastic surgery and intensive neonatal care. It gives me great pleasure to extend my good wishes to the management of HLH in all future endeavors and my sincere appreciation to the Chief Executive, Managing & Clinical Directors, and the hospital management for raising the standard of care to the accepted international level. This is indeed a singular distinction. My sincere thanks also go to all workers of the hospital for their dedicated services. Prof. Dr. Rashid Latif Khan Sitara-e-Imtiaz Pride of Obstetrics Gynecology in Pakistan & abroad CEO’s Message As Chief Executive Officer of Hameed Latif Hospital, it is my pleasure to welcome you on behalf of the 350+ dedicated consultants and more than 1,300 healthcare professionals who work together to provide essential health care services to help you achieve optimum long-term health. Health Care is a very serious enterprise especially when it comes to running a large tertiary care hospital where thousands of patients are served every year involving intricate diagnostic procedures and complex surgeries. As a tertiary care hospital, we feel a deep sense of pride and commitment to all those who place their trust in our care. Wishing you good health in all times. Mrs. Talat Khan Chief Executive Officer COO’s Message I am honored and delighted to serve as the Chief Operating Officer of one of the most exceptional healthcare establishments in the region, Hameed Latif Hospital. Since its establishment in 1992, the hospital has set the Gold Standard for healthcare providers, boasting state-of-the-art equipment that exceeds the expectations of its patrons. Our hospital is a unique blend of highly skilled and experienced consultants, top-quality nursing staff, and an energetic workforce supported by self-motivated support staff, all working in harmony to achieve the highest standards of quality healthcare.

It forms the backbone of any healthcare system, as, without the timely availability of safe blood products, countless lives can be in jeopardy. As per WHO, blood is considered an essential medicine that helps patients survive surgeries, cancer treatment, chronic illnesses, and traumatic injuries. The safe and rational use of blood products is required to minimize the risks associated with blood transfusion and maximize the benefits for the recipient.

They believe in saving lives and remain compassionate and vigilant to give you the care you deserve. The process of donating blood: After a brief physical examination, hemoglobin estimation, and donor questionnaire, the collection of blood is done by a healthy volunteer. The entire donation process is supervised by well-qualified staff and takes about 20-30 minutes. The blood collected is then separated into different components; packed red cells, platelets, and plasma. Screening for infections present in the blood (TTIs) is done using advanced CLIA/ELISA techniques to ensure the safety of blood products and each product is stored at a designated storage temperature. Upon request from the hospital, these products are provided for utilization in life-saving procedures.

Symptoms of infectious diseases Symptoms vary depending on the type of infection, but general symptoms can include: Fever Fatigue Muscle aches Diarrhea or vomiting Cough and sore throat Skin rashes Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to managing disease and infection effectively. How are infectious diseases diagnosed? Diagnosis often involves: Blood tests Urine cultures Imaging studies Biopsy or swab tests PCR testing for viruses like COVID-19 and Hepatitis At our infectious diseases department in Lahore, we use cutting-edge diagnostics to pinpoint the cause and guide effective treatment.

Difference between infectious diseases and noninfectious diseases?

Proper hygiene, vaccination, and healthcare access are essential in preventing the spread of disease and infection. Additional information/FAQs 1- What is infectious disease? An infectious disease is a medical condition caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites.

These professionals are crucial in ensuring patient safety and comfort, utilizing their expertise in both anesthesiology and pain management to deliver exceptional care in various clinical settings. Additional information/FAQs 1- What is Anesthesia & why is it important? Anesthesia refers to the use of medications (anesthetics) to prevent discomfort during surgical or medical procedures. Carefully calculated doses of anesthesia are extremely important for the success of any surgical or chronic pain management in anesthesia, as they relieve pain and sensation during the procedure. Whether you’re undergoing surgery or require specialized pain management services, the expertise of a doctor of anesthesiology is crucial. 2- How does Anesthesia work? Anesthesia works by blocking pain sensation in the nervous system, relieving us of unwanted physical discomfort during the surgical procedure. Under the effect of general anesthesia, you might be completely unconscious and will not feel anything during surgery, while regional anesthesia and pain medicine target specific areas, allowing for localized pain relief. 3- Are there any side effects or risks associated with the use of Anesthesia? The administration of anesthesia is overall a safe procedure. However, despite all necessary precautions, some patients might experience complications. The chances of complications are higher if there are underlying conditions like obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, or stroke. Our qualified team at HLH will monitor your condition closely to prevent complications, ensuring the best possible outcomes in both anesthesia and pain management. 4- Do I need to stop taking certain medications before my surgery? Your anesthesiologist will review your clinical history to determine the amount and type of anesthesia to be administered, and will provide detailed instructions regarding medication and preparations before surgery.

Additionally, if your cardiologist recommends surgical intervention for your heart condition, it’s essential to seek an evaluation from a cardiac surgeon. Open Heart Surgery What is Open Heart Surgery? Open heart surgery is a procedure that involves opening the chest to access the heart directly. This surgery is performed to treat various heart conditions, such as coronary artery disease, heart valve issues, and congenital heart defects.

This type of surgery requires a longer recovery time compared to minimally invasive techniques but can effectively address severe heart issues. Difference between Bypass and Open Heart Surgery Bypass surgery is a type of open heart surgery specifically aimed at improving blood flow to the heart by creating a detour around blocked arteries. In contrast, open heart surgery encompasses a broader range of procedures, including valve repair, heart transplants, and congenital defect corrections.

A cardiac surgeon is a specialized medical doctor trained to perform surgeries on the heart and its surrounding structures. These surgeons have extensive knowledge of the cardiovascular system and are skilled in procedures like valve repairs, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and heart transplants. They work closely with a team of healthcare professionals to ensure optimal patient care before, during, and after surgery. When to See a Cardiac Surgeon?

This surgery is performed to treat various heart conditions, such as coronary artery disease, heart valve issues, and congenital heart defects. During the procedure, the heart may be temporarily stopped, and a heart-lung machine may be used to maintain blood circulation. This type of surgery requires a longer recovery time compared to minimally invasive techniques but can effectively address severe heart issues. Difference between Bypass and Open Heart Surgery Bypass surgery is a type of open heart surgery specifically aimed at improving blood flow to the heart by creating a detour around blocked arteries. In contrast, open heart surgery encompasses a broader range of procedures, including valve repair, heart transplants, and congenital defect corrections.
